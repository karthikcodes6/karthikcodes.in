### WIP

1. Vision – Here, Ries puts forward the case for a new discipline of entrepreneurial management.
2. Steer – This section dives deeper into the Lean Startup business model.
3. Accelerate – Here, the focus is on how to get Lean Startups to speed through the ‘Build-Measure-Learn’ feedback loop as quickly as possible.

## Vision

### The Definition and Origins of the Lean Startup

The Lean Startup model takes its name from the Toyota manufacturing revolution as lead by Taiichi Ohno and Shigeo Shingo. 

**Toyota's Principles**

1. Drawing on the knowledge and creativity of individual employees
2. Shrinking batch sizes
3. Utilizing just-in-time production and inventory control
4. Accelerating cycle times

This approach highlighted the difference between value-generating behavior, and waste –  principles which the Lean Startup method carries across to the context of entrepreneurship.

**Right Process == Success Startup**

**The Lean Startup model**

1. Fast cycle times
2. Focusing on what the customer wants (without asking them first)
3. Using scientific approaches to make decisions

Thus, the Lean Startup business model is a novel approach to the development and innovation of new products which focuses on speedy iteration, customer insight, creative vision and sizable ambition, simultaneously.

### Validated Learning – a Novel Approach to Data

This approach to learning is more accurate, concise and quicker than traditional modes of market forecasting or corporate planning.

To first understand what validated learning means, we need to highlight which of our efforts are creating value, and which are creating waste. For example, rather than continually trying to update and improve a product, we should work out whether customers are interested in our product at all. Anything that isn’t providing value to the customer is waste.

Ship out a version of the product as quickly as possible to obtain real data. 

> Validated learning is the process of drawing conclusions from this data, based on actual customer behavior – not on the feedback customers may provide via a survey or interview about what they may hypothetically like about a product that they have not yet interacted with.

Essentially, don’t trust customers to know what they want ahead of time. Instead, trust the way they behave with a tangible version of the product and use this data to inform decisions going forward.

### Freedom to Experiment is Essential

Get the customers to interact with a product as quickly as possible as it is the results of this experimentation that determine the direction of the product.

**Zappos** followed this process to determine customers willingness to buy shoes:
1. Approached local shoe stores and took photos.
2. Posted pictures online to see if customers would buy them.
3. If they did, return to the store, buy the pair of shoes at full price, and send them on to the customer.

Zappos started small and employed the quickest way possible to test their hypothesis that there was a demand for online shoes.

Validated learning and fast experimentation are integral to the lean startup business method. 

1. Release the first iteration very soon.
2. Collect real world data as much as possible and kown what is and is not working in reality, 
3. Never ever assume this will work in the future only real data. 
4. All data only available "outside the building" i.e. in the real world. 

## Steer

### The Lean Startup Depends on Minimum Viable Products

**MVP**:

* Simply the quickest and most effortless way to zip through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop. 
* They facilitate the process of validated learning as quickly as possible.
* A product is built and tested in the real world, then its successes and failures are measured, and then, from the measurable data, validated learning can inform the next stage in the product’s development.

Principles:
* Don't add so many features, any feature that doesn’t contribute to what you need to learn should be removed.
* Don't worry about quality. Get the MVP to market as quickly as possible as it is a vital step towards building a high quality product.
* Getting negative feedback for MVPs are common, but this data is still valuable for validated learning and the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop. So, prepare employees for such results and instead encourage commitment to iteration, innovation, and to to see such setbacks as part of the process.
