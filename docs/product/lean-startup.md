## Vision

### The Definition and Origins of the Lean Startup

The Lean Startup model takes its name from the Toyota manufacturing revolution as lead by Taiichi Ohno and Shigeo Shingo. They transformed Toyota into a flourishing global company by focusing on the following principles:

1. Drawing on the knowledge and creativity of individual employees
2. Shrinking batch sizes
3. Utilizing just-in-time production and inventory control
4. Accelerating cycle times
5. This approach highlighted the difference between value-generating behavior, and waste –  principles which the Lean Startup method carries across to the context of entrepreneurship.

Ries, therefore, firmly believes that startup success is not necessarily about having a great idea, or even being in the right place at the right time; it is about following the right processes. Consequently, the Lean Startup model is based on the following:

1. Fast cycle times
2. Focusing on what the customer wants (without asking them first)
3. Using scientific approaches to make decisions

Thus, the Lean Startup business model is a novel approach to the development and innovation of new products which focuses on speedy iteration, customer insight, creative vision and sizable ambition, simultaneously.
