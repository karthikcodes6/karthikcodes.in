To-Do List Formula: A Stress-Free Guide To Creating To-Do Lists That Work!
Damon Zahariades

First, it will give you control over your workday. You’ll know what you need to work on and what can be put on the back burner. A good task management system will make your workday less chaotic.
LOCATION: 186

A solid to-do list will reveal the day’s top priorities based on their importance and urgency. It will show you instantly where you should devote your time and attention.
LOCATION: 188

your task list will show you what you need to work on based on each item’s urgency.
LOCATION: 192

Your task list removes the emotion so you can make good decisions that maximize your productivity.
LOCATION: 195

being productive isn’t about completing a long list of tasks. It’s not about staying busy. It’s about focusing on high-value activities that help you to accomplish your goals.
LOCATION: 197

41% of to-do items are never completed.
LOCATION: 215

50% of completed to-do items are done within a day.
LOCATION: 216

18% of completed to-do items are done within an hour.
LOCATION: 216

10% of completed to-do items are done within a minute.
LOCATION: 216

more than 40% of tasks are never finished. The implication is that the items are carried over to the following day, postponed indefinitely, or dropped altogether. These are not the signs of an effective task management system.
LOCATION: 218

people tend to pick tasks that appear easy to do. The problem with this approach is that it fails to address task priority.
LOCATION: 222

According to a survey by LinkedIn, nearly 90% of professionals admit to not getting through their task lists on a regular basis.
LOCATION: 227

By writing them down, you’ll collect them in one place and gain a bird’s-eye view of your biggest priorities.
LOCATION: 252

a solid to-do list will focus your attention on the right work and prevent you from getting sidelined by less-critical items.
LOCATION: 256

Your task list isn’t a tool for getting everything done. Rather, it’s a tool that will ensure you get the right things done.
LOCATION: 257

A to-do list without deadlines is a wish list. Nothing more. Without deadlines, we lean toward inaction.
LOCATION: 268

They help us to prioritize tasks and projects based on the amount of time we have to complete them.
LOCATION: 269

Without deadlines, there’s little impetus to act. Without an impetus, nothing gets done. This is the reason so many to-do lists spiral out of control, growing longer and longer by the day as tasks go unfinished.
LOCATION: 273

Deadlines are the enemy of procrastination. They motivate us to take action and finish tasks.
LOCATION: 276

Parkinson’s Law: “Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.”
LOCATION: 280

Lists that are too long eventually reach a point at which they become unmanageable.
LOCATION: 290

finish each day realizing that you failed to complete the day’s list of tasks. This outcome, experienced over and over, can be devastating to your motivation.
LOCATION: 292

failing to complete your to-do items day after day, you train your mind to accept that outcome.
LOCATION: 293

Many people do a brain dump of every task they need or want to get done. They record everything on a single list. The problem is, they neglect to categorize these tasks and put them on separate lists according to context, priority, and urgency.
LOCATION: 297

Items that will take three minutes to complete are listed next to items that will take three weeks. High-priority tasks are listed next to low-priority tasks that can be put on the back burner indefinitely.
LOCATION: 307

The more options we have, the less capable we are to decide between them and the more anxiety we experience as a result.
LOCATION: 312

A second consequence of having too much variability in your task lists is that you take longer to get things done.
LOCATION: 313

too much variability in your to-do lists increases your stress levels.
LOCATION: 315

Items are written down without any indication about the time needed to complete them, their priority, and the roles they play in achieving specific goals.
LOCATION: 352

to-do lists that offer no task-level context are ineffective. In fact, they do more harm than good.
LOCATION: 358

When you create a list of tasks without context, you end up with options that are difficult to choose from.
LOCATION: 365

Our goals spur us to take action. We’re less inclined to procrastinate when we’re able to predict the positive result of completing a specific task.
LOCATION: 400

Tally your points after you answer the questions and find out how skilled you truly are at creating effective to-do lists!
LOCATION: 426

Do you understand the primary role to-do lists serve in a task management system?
LOCATION: 427

Do you assign deadlines - a specific date rather than “by the end of the month” - to each to-do item?
LOCATION: 429

Do you limit the number of items on your to-do lists to 10? (If so, give yourself three points.) Do you limit the number to seven? (If so, give yourself five points.)
LOCATION: 430

Do you create your to-do lists with minimal variability? Focus on the time needed to complete each task as well as each task’s priority.
LOCATION: 432

Do your to-do lists limit your options concerning what you should spend your time on?
LOCATION: 435

Do you include context for each to-do item so you’ll know whether it’s a high-value or low-value task, and the time commitment involved?
LOCATION: 436

Do you define your tasks narrowly and with specificity so you can quickly identify when they’ve been completed?
LOCATION: 438

Do you associate each task with a specific goal?
LOCATION: 440

scored between 32 and 40 points, consider yourself a to-do list ninja.
LOCATION: 443

scored between 19 and 31, you’re doing reasonably well, but could stand to improve select areas of your task management strategy.
LOCATION: 445

scored 18 or fewer points, you need to rethink your approach to how you create your to-do lists.
LOCATION: 448

Studies show that chronic stress and fear can literally change how the brain functions. Our ability to process thoughts and make rational decisions suffers as stress hormones, such as cortisol, accumulate. Neuroscientists have discovered that, over time, this state can damage the brain, hampering our decision-making ability.
LOCATION: 465

pinpoint the reasons you’re experiencing these feelings. For example, do you feel guilty and depressed because you’ve missed important deadlines at your job?
LOCATION: 473

Once you’ve identified whatever is triggering your negativity, you can take steps to change your circumstances and relieve the pressure.
LOCATION: 475

your emotional state plays a significant role in how successfully you work from your lists.
LOCATION: 476

your to-do list is there to help you organize tasks according to their importance and priority, and identify where to best spend your limited time. You won’t be able to do that effectively if you’re struggling with persistent negativity.
LOCATION: 477

There’s nothing elegant about this strategy. It is essentially a brain dump. You write down every task you can think of onto a single list.
LOCATION: 495

First, your list will grow too long.
LOCATION: 497

Second, you’ll have too many options.
LOCATION: 498

Third, your list will have too much variability. Three-minute tasks will be listed next to three-hour tasks.
LOCATION: 500

It’s worth pointing out that doing a brain dump is an important step toward creating an effective to-do list.
LOCATION: 503

You might feel productive as you complete tasks and cross them off your list. But in reality, you’ll be inclined to choose easy, low-priority tasks that require minimal time to complete and leave the high-value items unaddressed.
LOCATION: 507

An individual may have a vague sense regarding the latest date by which a particular task must be completed, but he or she neglects to assign a formal due date to it.
LOCATION: 518

Deadlines are important because they prompt us to take action.
LOCATION: 520

Assuming our deadlines are realistic and take into account the comparative priorities of our to-do items, they increase our productivity. We not only get more things done, but we get more of the right things done.
LOCATION: 521

The tasks’ starting dates will prompt you to work on them early enough to meet their respective deadlines.
LOCATION: 527

Your master list is a rolling repository of every task you think of. It’s where you record every item, regardless of its priority, deadline, the time required to complete it, and the project with which it’s associated.
LOCATION: 541

Each evening, you would review your master list. You’d look for tasks due in the near future or those that need to be addressed in order to move other tasks forward. Once you identify these to-do items, you’d choose several and transfer them to the following day’s daily list, assuming your schedule allows adequate time to address them.
LOCATION: 550

It limits the number of tasks on your daily to-do list. There are five. No more. No less.
LOCATION: 566

The big ones can be finished in under two hours while the small ones should take less than 30 minutes. (Tasks that take longer than two hours to complete can usually be broken down into smaller tasks.)
LOCATION: 567

This feature of the “3+2” strategy makes it compatible with popular time management strategies like the Pomodoro Technique and timeboxing.
LOCATION: 569

minimizes task switching.
LOCATION: 574

fewer tasks to focus on, you’ll be less inclined to switch back and forth between them.
LOCATION: 575

This reduces switching costs, the loss in productivity that results from jumping between unrelated tasks.
LOCATION: 576

you choose one big task, three medium-sized tasks, and five small tasks to complete during the day.
LOCATION: 594

Not only does it allow you to choose more items to get done each day (nine vs. five), but it also presents three categories rather than just two.
LOCATION: 597

you’re left with multiple lists, one per project.
LOCATION: 618

Task-level context is inherent in this system as your lists are organized according to project.
LOCATION: 627

gives you a bird’s-eye view of your multiple projects in progress.
LOCATION: 629

MIT is an acronym. It stands for “most important task.” It’s the highest-priority item on your to-do list. It’s the one thing you must complete during the course of a given day.
LOCATION: 644

you select three high-priority tasks to focus on during your day. Whatever else happens, you must get these three items done.
LOCATION: 649

Grab a cork board and a stack of Post-It notes. Make three columns on your board. Title the left column “To Do.” Title the middle column “Doing.” Title the right column “Done.”
LOCATION: 671

It also makes it easy to prioritize items according to their respective due dates.
LOCATION: 677

allows you to track the progress of individual tasks.
LOCATION: 678

you can use different colored Post-It notes to represent varying levels of priority.
LOCATION: 681

Tasks are assigned to the quadrants according to their respective priorities. Those placed in the first quadrant should be addressed immediately. Those in the second quadrant are less dire, but should be scheduled to ensure they’re addressed at some point in the near future. Tasks in the third quadrant can be delegated to others while tasks in the fourth quadrant can be abandoned.
LOCATION: 704

it forces you to add context to each task.
LOCATION: 743

Part of GTD involves creating a “next actions” list and a “someday/maybe” list.
LOCATION: 744

GTD advises performing a weekly review.
LOCATION: 747

focuses more on processing the ideas in your head than actually getting them done.
LOCATION: 750

not enough attention is given to how each item captured on the “brain dump” list relates to your goals.
LOCATION: 751

it’s easy to get overwhelmed while using GTD.
LOCATION: 755

Getting Things Done is popular as a strategy for organizing tasks and creating to-do lists. There’s no doubt about that. But the more you research it, the more you’ll find that many people have tried and abandoned it.
LOCATION: 758

use a “current task” list to decide how to allocate your time and attention each day.
LOCATION: 803

Second, use a “future task” list to keep track of all the items that will need your attention at some point.
LOCATION: 804

Many people work from a single, massive to-do list that grows by the day as new items are added to it. This practice can be discouraging because there’s no end in sight.
LOCATION: 808

Its limited scope - remember, it only carries items that are to be completed that day - reduces stress and removes the sense of overwhelm.
LOCATION: 812

“next physical, visible activity that needs to be engaged in, in order to move the current reality toward completion.”
LOCATION: 814

You’ll find that completing each day’s to-do list will motivate and inspire you.
LOCATION: 816

We take action to effect specific outcomes. Otherwise, why would we spend time and effort doing things that prevent us from pursuing activities we find more enjoyable
LOCATION: 826

The simplest way to get through your daily to-do list is to assign a “why” to each item found on it.
LOCATION: 830

You’ll find that when you associate tasks with specific outcomes, you’ll feel more compelled to get them done.
LOCATION: 837

This is the reason many to-do “items” remain unfinished at the end of the day. They’re technically projects. They’re too large in scope and can seem overwhelming, which causes us to procrastinate.
LOCATION: 850

Breaking projects down into smaller tasks makes them seem more doable. It also allows you to focus your limited time and attention on tasks according to their priority and value.
LOCATION: 862

Make sure your to-do lists are limited to actionable tasks, not projects. If an item requires more than one action, it is a project that can - and should - be broken down.
LOCATION: 866

The date doesn’t have to be written in stone. It can change as the priority and urgency of the task to which it’s attached changes.
LOCATION: 876

First, make sure each deadline is realistic.
LOCATION: 884

Second, come up with a reason for each due date.
LOCATION: 885

Third, give yourself less time than you think you need.
LOCATION: 889

“work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.”
LOCATION: 890

One of the most common problems with to-do lists is that they’re too long. Those that start with just a few tasks invariably grow to include dozens.
LOCATION: 899

I strongly recommend limiting the number of items on your daily to-do list to seven. This is a manageable number. Assuming no single task requires hours to complete, it’s possible to get through your entire list by the end of the day.
LOCATION: 903

My “limit-to-seven” suggestion refers solely to tasks that require at least 15 minutes to complete.
LOCATION: 910

recognize that tiny tasks like “sort your mail” should not be among the seven items on your daily to-do list.
LOCATION: 917

Task-level context is an important part of any to-do list system. It defines how long items should take to complete. It reminds you of the reasons to get them done. It encourages you to focus on tasks that have the highest priorities given your goals.
LOCATION: 930

Project Type Location
LOCATION: 933

recommend creating a separate list for each project, each type of task, and each location.
LOCATION: 934

Task management is made simpler when irrelevant items are removed, or crossed off, your list.
LOCATION: 964

What types of tasks are candidates for removal? Look for these four items: Wishes Unclear tasks Trivial tasks Resolutions
LOCATION: 967

Trivial tasks can be eliminated without repercussions.
LOCATION: 976

Remove all resolutions from your master to-do list.
LOCATION: 981

In order to calculate a task’s estimated completion time, you must know what is required to do the task. This includes tools, information, and input from others.
LOCATION: 997

Review your master list and assign a time estimate to each item. Whether the item will take 15 minutes or 3 hours, write down the estimate next to it.
LOCATION: 1002

Resist the temptation to guess. We tend to be overly optimistic regarding our ability to get things done. We underestimate the time we need. Be aware of this tendency.
LOCATION: 1003

If you’re unfamiliar with the task, talk to someone who has worked on it in the past.
LOCATION: 1007

we also tend to give ourselves too much time to get things done.
LOCATION: 1010

This leniency is dangerous because it impairs our productivity. Recall Parkinson’s Law: “Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.”
LOCATION: 1013

Verbs have that power. Put them in front of your to-do items and you’ll be more inclined to get the items done.
LOCATION: 1023

The verb triggers something in the brain, prompting it to focus on completing the item.
LOCATION: 1025

Start a load of laundry Buy a cake for Sandra’s birthday
LOCATION: 1029

The right verbs encourage execution. They encourage you to take action. The wrong ones do the opposite. They encourage procrastination. Verbs like explore, plan, and touch base lack specificity. As a result, they’re less effective than verbs like research, draft, and call.
LOCATION: 1039

David Allen’s GTD advocates the creation of a separate “waiting for” list. This list would include every task for which you’re waiting for someone to act.
LOCATION: 1055

write a short note next to each to-do item for which you’re waiting for someone’s input. Detail the type of input you need, its format (email, phone call, report, spreadsheet, etc.), and the date you expect it to be delivered.
LOCATION: 1059

The purpose of a batch list is to organize all of your tiny tasks in one place.
LOCATION: 1083

Tiny tasks don’t belong on your daily to-do list.
LOCATION: 1085

Nor should tiny tasks remain on your master list.
LOCATION: 1087

place them on a separate batch list. When you have extra time, choose a few to work on.
LOCATION: 1087

They’ll tempt you to multitask, which will introduce task switching costs.
LOCATION: 1094

Batch these tiny tasks together. Set aside 30 to 45 minutes to work on them.
LOCATION: 1096

batch together tasks that are related by context.
LOCATION: 1098

Working on related to-do items minimizes switching costs.
LOCATION: 1100

When you add context to the tasks on your master list, you can quickly identify the ones you should work on.
LOCATION: 1131

suppose it’s mid-afternoon and your energy levels are low. You’d do well to focus on mindless work (e.g. data entry, decluttering your desk, etc.) rather than analytical or creative work (activity-based context).
LOCATION: 1133

Conduct Weekly Reviews
LOCATION: 1140

Gather all of your to-do lists. This includes your master list and context-based lists. Do a brain dump of all the tasks and projects floating around your head. Add them to your master list. Break down new projects into individual tasks. Separate new tasks according to context (project, type, and location). Create new context-based lists, if necessary. Clear out your email inbox. Send responses if they’re necessary. If an email requires you to take action, but isn’t urgent, make a note of it on your master to-do list and archive the message. Also, archive emails that don’t warrant a response or action, but may be needed later. Delete the rest. Review your master list and context-based lists. Purge tasks that are no longer necessary or important. Note the tasks that are both important and urgent. Mark them as candidates for your daily to-do list. Note the tasks for which you’re waiting on input from others. Write down the person’s name and the date you expect to receive his or her input. The date will tell you when to follow up if you don’t receive it. Review your current deadlines for high-value tasks. Make adjustments if necessary. Assign deadlines to new tasks you’ve added to your master list and context-based lists. Review your calendar for the coming week. Create your daily to-do list based on your availability.
LOCATION: 1157

Vague goal: retire early. Specific goal: retire by your 60th birthday with $2 million in liquid investments and a $5,000 monthly income.
LOCATION: 1183

They noted two remarkable findings. First, the 13% who had goals earned more than the 84% who had no goals. Second, the 3% who wrote down their goals earned 10 times as much as the 97% who did not write them down.
LOCATION: 1190

The third step is to review them monthly. Set aside 30 minutes at the end of each month to track your progress and reevaluate
LOCATION: 1193

When you focus on methodologies to the point that they become the priority, you risk forfeiting these goals.
LOCATION: 1215

your to-do list system is there to aid you, not control you.
LOCATION: 1222

Build And Follow A System That Works For YOU
LOCATION: 1223

Be Consistent
LOCATION: 1243

skipping a day or two can have a snowball effect.
LOCATION: 1253

“Jerry Seinfeld” strategy.
LOCATION: 1257

First, learn the 10 steps to creating an effective to-do list system.
LOCATION: 1258

Second, memorize the eight tips for ensuring your system runs smoothly over the long run.
LOCATION: 1259

Third, buy a wall calendar that displays the entire year on a single sheet.
LOCATION: 1261

After you’ve successfully done so, cross the day off with the red pen.
LOCATION: 1263
