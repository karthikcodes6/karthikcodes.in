Hey, I’m Karthik. I’m a software engineer based in India! I’m currently building a tool called [Sketchnote.co](https://sketchnote.co). 

Before Sketchnote.co I worked at LTI as a software engineer. I was also building a mobile app called Connected Senses based on the fitness domain.

I’m exploring more on real-time collaboration and rich text editing. I build plugins at Plate. And I’m trying to improve the performance of the Slate editor. 

I am excited about full-stack development, UX designing, design systems, mono repo architecture, building composable components and building component libraries.
