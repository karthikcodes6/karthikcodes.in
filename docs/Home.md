Hey, glad to see you here. My name is Karthik. I'm a software engineer based in India! I'm using this space to share my knowledge on the internet.

I write blogs:
* From setting up DNS for a custom domain in AWS to building a web application that scales to 5 million pages.
* From improving react performance using useMemo and useCallback to architecting a scalable frontend using mono repo.
* From choosing the best rich text editor to building tools like the Sketchnote app.
* From React's state reducer pattern to object-oriented patterns for backend APIs.
* From authentication patterns to authorization patterns
