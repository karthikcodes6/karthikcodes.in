Hey, I’m Karthik. I’m a software engineer based in India! I’m currently working at [Sketchnote.co](https://sketchnote.co). 

Before [Sketchnote.co](https://sketchnote.co) I worked at [LTI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/l&t-infotech/) as a software engineer. I was also building a mobile app called [Connected Senses](https://connected-senses.com/) based on the fitness domain.

I’m currently exploring more on real-time collaboration and rich text editing. I build plugins at [Plate](https://github.com/udecode/plate). And I’m trying to improve the performance of the [Slate](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate) editor. 

I've been building web/mobile apps using Javascript, Typescript, HTML, CSS, React, React Native, NodeJS, NextJS, Yarn, Rollup, MongoDB, Firebase, Firestore, Wordpress, Strapi. 

I'm interested on UX design, design systems, mono repo architecture, building composable/scalable components and building component libraries.
