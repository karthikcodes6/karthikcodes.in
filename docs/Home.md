Hey, I’m Karthik. I’m a software engineer based in India!.

I’m currently exploring more on real-time collaboration and rich text editing. Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/karthikcodes6), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/karthikcodes6).

I've been building web/mobile apps using Javascript, Typescript, HTML, CSS, React, React Native, NodeJS, NextJS, Yarn, Rollup, MongoDB, Firebase, Firestore, Wordpress, Strapi.

I'm interested on UX design, design systems, mono repo architecture, building composable/scalable components and building component libraries.
